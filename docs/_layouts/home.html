            <p>If you would prefer to include the JS files directly in your HTML, without any transpiling you can still do this through the <code>dist</code> folder. This method provides limited flexability and so is not the recommended way for production.</p>

            <p>If you would like to include a single plugin you can include that plugin using the below syntax. This should be placed in the closing body of your page, so that the DOM has loaded ready for the plugin to search for any DOM apis.</p>

        <div class="notification is-warning">
            This method is not recommended if you are using more than one plugin, as each independent file has the core packaged with it. It is recommended to instead use the ES6 method to build your own collection.
